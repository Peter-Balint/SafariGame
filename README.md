# SafariGame

Tycoon type safari management game made in the Unity game engine as part of the course "Szoftvertechnol√≥gia" at ELTE, in a team of three people. 
Running the game requires an install of Unity, as it is not published as of this moment.

Architecture follows the model-view distinction, with Unity's MonoBehaviours serving as view classes. Unit tests are made via the Unity Test Framework (based on NUnit), code coverage available as part of the test runner. It is recommended to change the report's output location in the analysis settings.

Originally hosted on a private GitLab server.
