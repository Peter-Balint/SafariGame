# SafariGame

Tycoon type safari management game made in the Unity game engine as part of the course "Szoftvertechnol√≥gia" at ELTE, in a team of three people. 
Running the game requires an install of Unity, as it is not published as of this moment. The scene "Production" reflects the most up to date state of the game, and is the one guaranteed to run as intended.

Architecture follows the model-view distinction, with Unity's MonoBehaviours serving as view classes. Unit tests are made via the Unity Test Framework (based on NUnit), code coverage available as part of the test runner. It is recommended to change the report's output location in the analysis settings.

Originally hosted on a private GitLab server. After import, only commits on Master show up in my contribution history, I advise looking at other branches as well, however they will be more cluttered and the readme won't be updated there.

Project is finished, and further work on it is unlikely other than fixes or cleaning up.
